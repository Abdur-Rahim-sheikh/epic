### What is set?
A collection of distinct objects

### set notations
1. **Roster or Tabular form**: List of elements within curly braces.
    * Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2. **Semantic notation**: A rule or condition that describes the elements of a set.
    * Example: Let A be the set of all even numbers less than 10. 
                or Let B be the set of things on my table.
3. **Set builder notation**: A rule or condition that describes the elements of a set.
    * Example: A = {x | x is an even number less than 10}
4. **Membership**: If an element belongs to a set, it is denoted by ∈.
    * Example: If _x_ is an element of set A, then x ∈ A.
5. **Subset**: If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. It is denoted by ⊆.
    * Example: If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then A ⊆ B.
    * Proper subset: If A is a subset of B and A is not equal to B, then A is a proper subset of B. It is denoted by ⊂.
    * Universal set: The set of all possible elements under consideration is called the universal set. It is denoted by U.

### Cardinality of a set
The number of elements in a finite set is called the cardinality of the set. It is denoted by |A| or #A.
* Example: If A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then |A| = 5.
    tricky question:
    * | ∅ | = 0
    * | {∅} | = 1
    * | 1, {1, 3}, ∅, x | = 4
