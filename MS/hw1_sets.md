## Home work on sets

1. For A = {1, 2}, B = {−1, 0, 1} and the universal set U = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2},
determine which of the following sets has cardinality 2:

- $A \cap B$ 
- $A \oplus B$ 
- $A - B$ 
- $\overline{B}$   &#10003;
- $A \times B$

2. Let A = {1, 2}, B = {1, 4, 5} and C = {3, 4} be subsets of the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Choose the true proposition:

- $A \cap B = \emptyset$ - // This is the right answer
- $A \cup B \subseteq B$
- The sets $B - A$ and $C$ are disjoint
- $A \subseteq \overline{B}$
- $C \subseteq A \cup \overline{B}$ 

3. What is relevant to the axiom of choice?
- It can be proved.
- It can be disproved.
- It can be accepted as true. //This is the right answer
- This axiom is about existence of the empty set.
- This axiom is about existence of infinite sets.
