1. Write each of the following sets by listing it's elements.
    - A = {n ∈ Z: $n^2-n-2<0$}
        - {-1, 0, 1}
    - B = {x ∈ R: $x^3=x$}
        - {-1, 0, 1}
    - C = {x ∈ Z: $-4 < x <= 4$}
        - {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    - D = {x ∈ N: $n^3<100$}
        - {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    - E = {x ∈ R: $x^2+5=0$}
        - {}
