## Practice 1: Set Theory

All question for this practice are listed [here](https://elearn.epam.com/courses/course-v1:UNIVERSITY+MS+0924/courseware/900d43d1d37d48808677f88e369ee2f5/6c3df91764c84a73845bcddd518d9e8b/).

1. Write each of the following sets by listing it's elements.
    - A = {n ∈ Z: $n^2-n-2<0$}
        - {-1, 0, 1}
    - B = {x ∈ R: $x^3=x$}
        - {-1, 0, 1}
    - C = {x ∈ Z: $-4 < x <= 4$}
        - {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    - D = {x ∈ N: $n^3<100$}
        - {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    - E = {x ∈ R: $x^2+5=0$}
        - {}

2. Let S = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Describe each of the following subsets of _S_ as {x ∈ S: P(x)}. Where _P(x)_ is some open sentence involving elements x  ∈ S.
    - A = {1,2,3,4}
        - {x ∈ S: $x > 0$}
    - D = {-2, 0, 2, 4}
        - {x ∈ S: $x$ is even}

3. Describe each of the following sets in symbols.
    - The set of all integers whose absolute value is at most 3.
        - {x ∈ Z: $-3 \leq x \leq 3$}
        - {x ∈ Z: $|x| \leq 3$}
    - The set of all positive integers whose square root is also an integer.
        - {x ∈ N: $x = n^2$ for some n ∈ N}

4. Describe each of the following sets in words.
    - {x ∈ R: $X^5 - 3x^3 - x^2 + 4x -1 = 0}
        - The set of all real numbers x such that $x^5 - 3x^3 - x^2 + 4x -1 = 0$
    - {x ∈ Z: $n/3$ ∈ Z}
        - The set of all integers x such that x is divisible by 3.

5. For each of the following sets, indicate whether 2 is an element of the set.
    - A = {x ∈ Q: $x(x-2) = 0$}
        - x = {0, 2} so 2 is an element of A.
    - B = {x ∈ R - Q: $x(x-2) = 0$}
        - x = {0, 2} so 2 is an element of B.
    - C = {{2}}
        - No, 2 is not an element of C. Rather {2} is an element of C. but $2 \neq {2}$.

6. Give examples of three sets A, B and C such that,
    - A ∈ B and B ∈ C and A ∉ C
        - A = {1}, B = {1, 2}, C = {{1, 2}, 3}

7. Let A = {1, 2, ...., 10}. Give an example of a set B such that.
    - B is a subset of A and |B| = 5
        - Then B can be, {{},{1},{2},{1,2},{1,3}}
    - B is an element of P(A) and |B| = 5
        - Then B can be, {1,2,3,4,5}

    - **Note**: Did you see the difference first one asks for subset and second one asks for element of power set. So, be careful while answering.
