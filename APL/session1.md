### Task 1
Consider a [table of early computer characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#Early_digital_computer_characteristics). You will see there that Zuse’s Z3 machine was Turing complete “in theory”. Research this a little: what does that mean? Why did that computer lack for being “practically Turing-complete”?

**Response:** The Z3's lack of conditional branching and fixed-point arithmetic operations made it "Theoritically" turing complete, because it had no loop control or conditional branching. Though without them we can theoritically solve a algorithm but would need huge ammount of line which no computer storage might be able to hold, so it was not "Practically" turing complete. 

### Task 2
Consider [Atanasoff–Berry computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_computer). Was is Turing-complete? What were its pioneering contributions?

 **Response:** The Atanasoff–Berry computer was neither programmable nor turing complete. It was a special-purpose machine designed to solve systems of linear algebraic equations. It was the first electronic digital computer. It was the first to use binary digits to represent data and perform calculations. It was the first to use electronic switches to perform calculations.
