### What is asymtotics (strict)?
Asymptotic notation is a way to represent the time complexity of an algorithm. It is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. The most common asymptotic notations are Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta. <br>
`f(x) =~ O(g(x)) <=> all(x) > C1: f(x)/g(x) < C2`
